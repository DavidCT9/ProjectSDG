          <p class="card-text">
            SDG stands for Sustainable Development Goal. The Sustainable Development Goals are a set of 17 goals that
            were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty,
            protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.<br>
            The SDGs are interconnected and indivisible. They address all dimensions of sustainable development:
            economic, social and environmental. The SDGs are also global in nature and universality is one of their core
            principles. This means that they apply to all countries, developed and developing alike.</p>

          <p class="card-text">The objective of this project is to make more people aware of the current damage that our
            planet is suffering day-by-day. Our website will show a real time map of the world but with different colors
            in each zone representing how much if affected that place because of climate change.<br>
            And it's not all about of bad news, the map purpose is to make an impact on the people and understand how
            every day the consequences are spreading around the world. But by the other hand, the idea of the page is
            also embedded some videos that can be filtered by topic; these videos can include topics such as hacks to
            save water, fast-fashion awareness, reforestation, eco-friendly tips to improve our environment, etc.

          <h5 class="card-title">Climate what?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We all know what climate change is. It is the long-term alteration of temperature and
            typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a
            whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. A region might experience lower or
            higher than average temperatures. Climate change may cause more frequent and severe weather events, such as
            storms, floods, and droughts.<br>
            We need to transition to a more sustainable economy that respects the environment. We need to reduce our
            consumption and waste. We need to invest in renewable energy and clean technologies. We need to protect our
            forests and oceans. And we need to educate ourselves and others about the importance of environmental
            protection.<br>

            Climate change is our greatest challenge, but it is also our greatest opportunity. We have the opportunity
            to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come. We can create a more sustainable and
            equitable world. We can protect our planet and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live a healthy
            and fulfilling life.<br>

            We must start today.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Why we chose this topic?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Where will we live? This is the main question we must ask ourselves as we face the
            challenges of climate change. We cannot solve other problems if we continue to harm our planet every day
            with our decisions. We must first ensure the health and perseverance of our home, so that we can continue to
            live on it and address other issues.<br>
            As Mexicans, we are well aware of the consequences of destroying our world continuously. Mexico has one of
            the most polluted cities in the world. Our beaches are more contaminated and polluted each year. Our soil is
            damaged by fertilizers and hog farms in the south. The list goes on.<br>

            This is not okay. We need to recognize and be aware of the type of lifestyle many people are having right
            now. Social media and capitalism promote one-use containers, fast fashion, consumerism, utilitarianism, and
            other behaviors that are pushing us to the brink of extinction. We are extracting resources from the Earth
            at an unprecedented rate, and the consequences are becoming more severe each day.</p>
